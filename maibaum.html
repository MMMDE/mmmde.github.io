				<em>Why Modelling Succeeds in Engineering: a Cookbook Approach to Modelling in MDE</em>
			</h3>
		</div>
		<p>
			Mathematical modelling is pervasive in classical engineering, though
			it may use informal representations to communicate the models. This is
			what enables systematic and “normal” (refer Vincenti) approaches to
			solving engineering problems, which is the true basis of engineering.
			The models help classify problems, and, a problem having been
			classified, normal engineering enables the application of cookbook
			methods for their solution. There is no question that these models
			have to be mathematically based, even if an informal representation
			may prove sufficient in a given situation. Modelling is performed in
			standardized notations and using formalisms that have proved their
			value over time. The representation of the mathematics may not be that
			of the mathematicians who developed the mathematics, but instead may
			be “engineering oriented”.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, what is not often noticed is that modelling itself is subject
			to normal practices, in the sense of Vincenti. So, problems are
			classified, appropriate models are known in outline for a given class
			of problems (refer Polanyi), standard analysis methods are available
			for given classes of models. So engineering models themselves are
			subject to cookbook methods. (In case you did not notice, this is
			actually an application of the metamodelling methodology in action!)
