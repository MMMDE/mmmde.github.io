			Software engineering (SE) strives to learn from matured engineering
			disciplines, such as mechanical and electrical engineering (below physical
			engineering, PE), and MDE is an essential step in this direction. Mathematical
			models are fundamental for PE, but should it be so for SE? What are
			similarities and differences in the development and use of mathematical models
			in SE vs. PE? How can SE and MDE benefit from a better understanding of these
			similarities and differences? These questions become even more challenging
			when we recognize that mathematical modelling and formalization are not
			identical (although closely related), and the abundance of formal models in SE
			may actually hide the lack of mathematical models with all its negative (but
			perhaps negligible?) consequences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Such questions are seldom addressed in the MDE literature, but we believe
			they deserve special attention. The MMMDE Workshop aims at gathering
			together MDE experts who are concerned with developing mathematical
			foundations for MDE, understanding the role of mathematical models in
			engineering in general and SE in particular, and with relating these general
			thoughts to practical MDE problems. We want to “test the waters”, and try to
			solidify broadly formulated concerns outlined above into several well-focused
			research questions or directions.
